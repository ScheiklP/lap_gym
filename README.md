## Content

This is the meta-repository of the project "LapGym - An Open Source Framework for Reinforcement Learning in Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery".

It contains the following submodules:

- [sofa_env](https://github.com/ScheiklP/sofa_env): Defines reinforcement learning environments for robot-assisted surgery.
- [sofa_godot](https://github.com/ScheiklP/sofa_godot): Provides a Godot plugin to visually create new SOFA scenes.
- [sofa_zoo](https://github.com/ScheiklP/sofa_zoo): Provides the code for the reinforcement learning experiments described in [LapGym paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09606)

Please refer to the individual submodels and the [LapGym paper](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v24/23-0207.html) for more information.
